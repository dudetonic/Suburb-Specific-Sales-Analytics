# Suburb-Specific-Sales-Analytics
A data analysis and business intelligence project focused on transforming raw sales data into actionable, location-based insights. The primary goal is to provide a granular view of performance by tracking key metrics and trends across specific suburbs and local markets. The output is a multi-dimensional visualization suite (dashboards) designed for strategic resource allocation, sales forecasting, and identifying geographically-driven growth opportunities.
